This project explores the interconnectedness of **sea level rise**, **CO₂ emissions**, and **air pollution**, providing data-driven insights into the impact of human activity on global climate change. Conducted as part of the **MSc in Data Analytics** at the **National College of Ireland**.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze and visualize the relationship between rising sea levels and key environmental factors such as temperature, carbon emissions, and air pollutants (PM2.5, NO₂, CO, O₃), using structured and unstructured datasets.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📊 **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Used Python (Pandas, Plotly) to clean, explore, and visualize environmental data trends.
- 🗃️ **ETL Pipeline with Luigi**: Automated data processing pipeline (Extract → Transform → Load) from MongoDB to PostgreSQL.
- 🛢️ **Multi-format Data Handling**: Integrated CSV and JSON datasets using both NoSQL (MongoDB) and relational (PostgreSQL) databases.
- 📈 **Comparative Insight Generation**: Created dashboards to show how increased emissions correlate with rising sea levels over time.
